There are two options for sealed on MTGA since there isn't an in-house official sealed offering yet. For both options, 
you will need to purchase 12 packs of Ikoria. In a paper Magic sealed, sealed you get 6x packs with each pack containing
15 cards for a total of a 90 card pool. In MTGA, you get only 8 cards per pack, so we will be opening 12x packs for a total
of 96 cards in your pool of available cards. You will also get 12 rares and 24 uncommons, which will increase the power 
level of your deck substantially. Furthremore, there are wild cards in MTGA. For our purposes, the best option for wild cards
is to let you use them as you see fit. The other options weren't as much fun. May the odds ever be in your favor for opening
 many Mythic wildcards.
 
 There is no option in MTGA to show you only recently opened cards in your collection. For that reason, we are specifying the 
 sealed procedure here. There is a technical and non-technical version of keeping track of your booster cards. We are using
 the honor system and you will forever be hated and laughed at if you cheat. Finally, we will be challenging eachother directly
 with the built in systems. Make sure to tell us your username in the discord channel.
